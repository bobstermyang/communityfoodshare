Community Food Share WordPress Plugin
===================


This plugin was built for Community Food Share, a local non-profit in the Denver Metro Area.
All of the code written was done during the <a href="https://givefirsthackfest.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">`TechStars Give First HackFest`</a>, a three day hackathon in Boulder, CO. Sorry in advance for the messy code.


----------

What is it?
-------------
This plugin adds to WordPress a "Kickstarter" like donation system. Community Food Share gave us a pretty complex process for the donations so I'll explain it. 

Companies can register to create a company profile to which people can donate to. Each company has the option of creating teams in the company. This is for team vs team challenges in a company. However, all teams must be registered during the company registration. Community Food Share doesn't want additional teams to be created in a company after the initial registration.

After a company is registered, a company page is created and the company is added to the main list of companies.

Usage
-------------

**Production**
The plugin isn't ready for production use.

**Testing**
You can test the plugin by downloading the zip file on the Releases page or by cloning this repo. Then you would upload it to your WordPress site like you would any other plugin

> **Note:**

> - Only tested on WordPress 4.4
